## Summary
Most of the users are subscribers and it appears males have a higher propensity of being subscribers. Starting and ending locations seem to be pretty similar. Most of the
rentals are in 5-10 minute intervals, with almost all of them being less than an hour. Males make up two-thirds of all the riders. The peak rental times on weekdays is both at
8am and again between 5 and 7pm. On the weekends there are consistent rentals from 10 am to 8pm.

For further analysis, one should compare the population sizes of New York City to Des Moines and also compare the tourism received in both locations. A second visualization to add may be relating the climate and weather of each city and how that may affect the profitability of such a business in the Midwest versus the Northeast.
